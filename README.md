# Image-Search-Bar
Vanilla JS Image Search Bar

Using this app the user can input the text they want images about. They can ask for more pictures of the same search without losing the previous ones. This project uses the unsplash API to get the images. In script.js you can find a const 'key' where you should enter your unsplash key.

This is my version of a project you can find here https://www.100jsprojects.com/
